# Assessment 2
# create a class of Wallet
# in wallet, there should be three features
# the wallet should have a self variable for coin balance
# you should be able to initialize the wallet's coin count with a number, else it should default to 0
# the wallet should have a function/method remove_money_from_wallet(x) - remove x number of coins out of the wallet
# NOTE: a wallet cannot give out more than the coins it has, it should fail to give out and print an error
# the wallet should have a function/method  put_money_into_wallet(x) -- put x number of coins into the wallet
# NOTE: a wallet cannot store more than 100 coins, it should *not accept* the full amount that would push it over 
# and print an error
# print_balance() prints the current number of coins the wallet has 
# you must run the following tests on your wallet

my_wallet = Wallet(25)
my_wallet.put_money_into_wallet(10)
my_wallet.remove_money_from_wallet(5)
my_wallet.put_money_into_wallet(20)
print(my_wallet.print_balance()) # answer should be 50

your_wallet = Wallet()
your_wallet.put_money_into_wallet(25)
your_wallet.put_money_into_wallet(100) # this should fail with a message
your_wallet.remove_money_from_wallet(30)  # this should fail with a message
print(your_wallet.print_balance()) # answer should be 25

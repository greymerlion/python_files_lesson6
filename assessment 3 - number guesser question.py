# Assessment 3
# This is a program that plays a number guessing game.
# The program should generate a random number between 1 to 100
# You must ask the user to guess the number
# The program should loop until the user has correctly guessed the number
# For each guess, we will tell the user if the number is lower or higher
# If the user has guessed correctly, we will congratulate the user
# and print out the number of tries the user took.
# If the user has guessed incorrectly, the program should ask the user to guess again
